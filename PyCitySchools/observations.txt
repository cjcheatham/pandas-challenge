There are two conclusions that can be derived from the analysis of this data on schools. Theses are as follows:

1) The top 5 highest perfoming schools based on the overall passing percentage were all charter schools, while district schools were in the top 5 bottom performing schools.

2) Schools with a lower spending range per student, as well as a smaller school size, yielded the highest overall passing percentage.
